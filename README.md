# Top250Movies
Create test application with a list of movies using IMDB service API https://imdb-api.com/api.
# Conditions that should be met:
 - Create a screen with the first 10 results from the list of TOP250Movies.
 - Result cell has to contain title, rank and image.
 - Cell selection action has to redirect to the next screen.
 - Count the occurrence of each character in the title that you have received before and display results using any UI component.
 - Display results using any UI component (for example UITableView or UICollectionView).
 # Important notes:
 - Everything should be done without third-party libs.
 - UI can be very simple but should be responsive, precise, accurate and done according to guidelines.
 # Will be a plus:
 - response data local cache, image cache, any tests
 - fulfillment of UI with pull-to-refresh, custom transition between screens, local/remote search.
